          <p>I am fairly new to the web development space. In September of 2023, I decided it was time for a career change and enrolled in the University of Minnesota's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I completed this course in December of the same year.</p>
          <p>I graduated in 2014 with a degree in Biology from St. Johnâ€™s University located in MN. After graduation, I started working as a contract Analytical Chemist for 3M. Shortly after I was hired on full time and continuted to move of the analytical ladder. In May of 2023, after 9 amazing years, I was laid off. The final title I held was "Senior Manufacturing Technology Engineer". It was my responsibility to bridge the gap between the manufacturing and chemistry worlds. I used chemical analytical tools to solve a wide range code red manufacturing problems, many that involved legacy products.</p>
          <p>The career change to Full-stack Web Development is both nerve-racking and exciting. In September of 2022 (exactly one year prior to the start of my bootcamp) I talked with a software engineer about making the career change. I tried the free 'Harvard CS50 - Intro to Computer Science' course to get my feet wet. I immediately fell in love with coding, especially the problem-solving aspect. The University of Minnesota's Full Stack Web Development Bootcampt was a welcome challenge. I enjoyed learning from the ground up. Starting with HTML/CSS/Javascript and working up to producint multiple MERN stack web applications.</p>
          <p>When it comes to coding, I enjoy both the frontend and backend aspects. On the frontend I like making things user friendly. On the backend, I enjoy the figuring out how to organize the data in the most logical way to met the frontend's needs.</p>
